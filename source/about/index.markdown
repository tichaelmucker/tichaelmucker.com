#About

I have been a web professional since 2002, and a web hobbyist long before that. My titles have evolved, but I've always been hellbent on providing the most effective, predictable, and hopefully enjoyable, user experience possible. My technical skills are primarily in the area of front-end development and theming, but I am also valuable in the strategy and conception phase of projects.
